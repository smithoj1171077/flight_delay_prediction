Meeting minutes 4/10/2024
-	Proposed research question: relationship between model complexity and potential trade-offs for generalisation performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data
-	We decided to delimit in distribution and out of distribution temporally (performance in year x for models trained only in year y).
-	Following algorithms chosen: Multivariate Linear regression, Gradient Boosted Tree, Graph Attention Network with Spatial-Temporal Features
-	Michelle is assigned to get out of distribution data for another year
-	Kezia assigned to building tabular features
-	Oliver assigned to building graph features
-	Next meeting agreed for the Tuesday the 7th of October
